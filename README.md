[The Developer Guide](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive)

#### An interesting approach of mainly using controllers inside of directives:
[How I've Improved My Angular Apps By Banning Ng-Controller](http://teropa.info/blog/2014/10/24/how-ive-improved-my-angular-apps-by-banning-ng-controller.html)

#### More about bindToController:

#### Technologies used to build this presentation:
* [impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js) as the presentation framework
* [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) for code highlighting
* [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) for compiling sass and bundling with livereload-like capabilities while developing
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) because css is a pain sometimes
* [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) because vendor prefixes don't have to be worried about
